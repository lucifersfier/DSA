#Insert at the Beginning
'''Write a function that takes a tuple and a value, and returns a new tuple with the value inserted at the
beginning of the original tuple.'''

#Example
'''
input_tuple = (2, 3, 4)
value_to_insert = 1
output_tuple = insert_value_front(input_tuple, value_to_insert)
print(output_tuple)'''


# Expected output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
def insert_value_at_beginning(input_tuple, value_to_insert):
    return (value_to_insert,) + input_tuple

#Explanation

'''def insert_value_at_beginning(input_tuple, value_to_insert): -
Define a function called "insert_value_at_beginning" that takes a tuple "input_tuple" and a value "value_to_insert"
as arguments.'''

'''return (value_to_insert,) + input_tuple -
Create a new tuple with the given value as the first element and concatenate the original tuple "input_tuple" to it.
The comma after the value is necessary to create a single-element tuple. Return the new tuple.'''

#Time and Space Complexity

'''def insert_value_at_beginning(input_tuple, value_to_insert): -
Define a function called "insert_value_at_beginning" that takes a tuple "input_tuple" and a value "value_to_insert"
as arguments. No time or space complexity associated with this line as it is just a function definition.

return (value_to_insert,) + input_tuple -
This line creates a new tuple with the given value as the first element
followed by the elements of the original tuple. The tuple concatenation operation has a linear time complexity O(n),
where n is the length of the input tuple, as it creates a new tuple by copying the elements from the original tuple.
The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new tuple with n+1 elements.'''

'''The overall time complexity of the function is O(n) because it iterates through the elements of the
input tuple once to create a new tuple.
The overall space complexity is O(n) because it creates a new tuple with n+1 elements.'''
