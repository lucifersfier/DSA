'''In object oriented, we are trying to model the real life objects
and those objects have things and they also can do things'''

'''the things that they have are their attributes and they are usually modeled with the variables
and the things that they can do are called methods they are modeled by the function'''

'''An object is a way of combining some piece of data and some functionality all together in the same thing'''

# All objects have: -
'''Identity, Attributes, Behaviours'''

'''A class is a detailed description. The definition, the template of an object will be,
but it's not the object itself '''

'''A class can have attributes to describe the objects such as weight, color and other things.'''

'''A method is a block of code or procedure that can be called to perform some actions and it may return a value'''

'''methods are basically functions with the key difference that methods are defined as a part of the clas
so that means they are included in an object in that class and since methods exist as a part of object they can 
only access the data that is known to that specific object.'''
