#Diagonal
'''Create a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a tuple containing the diagonal elements of the input.'''


#Example
'''
input_tuple = (
    (1, 2, 3),
    (4, 5, 6),
    (7, 8, 9)
)'''
'''output_tuple = get_diagonal(input_tuple)'''

'''print(output_tuple)  '''

# Expected output: (1, 5, 9)

def get_diagonal(input_tuple):
    return tuple(input_tuple[i][i] for i in range(len(input_tuple)))
                

    
#Explanation

'''def get_diagonal(input_tuple): - Define a function called "get_diagonal" that takes a tuple of tuples
"input_tuple" as an argument.

return tuple(input_tuple[i][i] for i in range(len(input_tuple))) -
Use a generator expression to iterate through the indices i from 0 to the length of the input tuple minus one,
and select the diagonal elements by indexing the inner tuples with the same index i.
Create a new tuple containing the selected diagonal elements and return it.'''

#Time and Space Complexity

'''def get_diagonal(input_tuple): - Define a function called "get_diagonal" that takes a tuple of tuples
"input_tuple" as an argument.
No time or space complexity associated with this line as it is just a function definition.

return tuple(input_tuple[i][i] for i in range(len(input_tuple))) -
This line uses a generator expression to iterate through the indices i from 0 to the length of the input tuple
minus one, and select the diagonal elements by indexing the inner tuples with the same index i.
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input tuple because it iterates through the indices once.
The space complexity is O(n) because it creates a new tuple containing the diagonal elements,
which has a length equal to the length of the input tuple.'''

#The overall time complexity of the function is O(n)
'''because it iterates through the indices of the input tuple once to create a new tuple with the diagonal elements.'''
#The overall space complexity is O(n)
'''because it creates a new tuple containing the diagonal elements, which has a length equal to the length of the input tuple.'''
